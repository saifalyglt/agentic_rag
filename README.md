# Agentic RAG

This repository provides an implementation of an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework designed to enhance text generation capabilities using retrieval mechanisms. It combines the power of language models with retrieval-based augmentation to create dynamic, efficient, and context-aware generative pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Workflow**: Integrates retrieval mechanisms to fetch relevant context/documents dynamically during text generation.
- **Agentic Approach**: Incorporates agents for orchestrating tasks and decisions, ensuring modularity and scalability.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Allows for fine-tuning and adaptation to various use cases, such as question answering, summarization, and content generation.
- **Efficient Handling of Large Datasets**: Optimized for working with extensive corpora for retrieval.

## Components

1. **Language Model Integration**: Utilizes state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to handle generative tasks.
2. **Retriever Module**: Implements a retriever (e.g., vector-based or keyword-based) to fetch relevant information for augmentation.
3. **Agent Orchestration**: Manages the interaction between the retriever and the language model, ensuring the right context is passed to the generator.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepares datasets for indexing and retrieval, including text cleaning and embedding generation.
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes tools to evaluate the quality of generation and retrieval using metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and relevance scores.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saifalyglt/agentic_rag.git
cd agentic_rag
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

Prepare your dataset for retrieval by generating embeddings:

```python
# Example code for embedding generation
from retriever import Embedder

embedder = Embedder()
embeddings = embedder.generate_embeddings(dataset)
```

### Running the Pipeline

Execute the RAG pipeline with your data and queries:

```python
from pipeline import RAGPipeline

pipeline = RAGPipeline()
response = pipeline.run(query="What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?")
print(response)
```

### Customization

You can customize the retriever, agent logic, and language model by modifying the configuration files or extending the classes in the `modules` directory.

## Applications

- **Question Answering**: Provide precise and contextually relevant answers.
- **Document Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of large documents.
- **Knowledge Base Augmentation**: Build enhanced conversational agents with dynamic knowledge retrieval.
- **Content Creation**: Assist in writing articles, reports, and more with context-aware generation.
